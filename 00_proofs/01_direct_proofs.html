		<h1>Simple Direct Proofs</h1>
		<article>
			<p>
				A direct proof starts with the hypothesis and traverses through logical steps in order to reach the conclusion. The following simple examples will illustrate the direct proof. It will also reveal some basic facts about number theory that will be useful
				in other examples which illustrate more complicated techniques used in direct proofs. Like geometry, understanding the foundation of number theory will lead to understanding of more complicated problems.
			</p>
			<p>
				When following proofs, they will be in the form of a table. It will be assumed that each statement except the first uses the previous statement unless stated otherwise. That way, the proof will have a logical flow. In more complicated proofs however,
				many different branches may need to be proven. When that is the case, we will create a table for each proposition. These propositions are developed such that they eventually prove the theorem. Complicated proofs will not show up in this section so
				there will be no propositions here. In the next few sections, however, there will be propositions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another note to mention is that it is assumed that you know about the basic Postulates of Equality. A reference table will be given in the <a href='resources.html'>resources page</a> for this chapter. In addition, all of these property will be used
				in combination for the sake of brevity unless not knowing the property used will make the proof difficult to read.

				For a problem like this, it might be easier to use an Axiom for integers. (Although this property, known as closure, can be proven, it is not in the scope of this subject and hence will be assumed to be true).

				Now if one realizes that one of these numbers $b$ can be expressed as $c-a$, one can use this Axiom for this problem.

			<h2>Parity of Addition</h2>
			<p>
				For three given integers, $a$, $b$, $c$ where $a+b=c$, two conditions exist:
