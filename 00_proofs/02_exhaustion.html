			<h1>Proof By Case / Exhaustion</h1>
			<p>
				Proof by cases or (Method of Exhaustion) goes about by decomposing a problem into several cases and then proving each of these simpler cases to conclude the proof. Although the process is straightforward, when there are many cases, such as the Four Color
				Theorem or Proof of Kepler's Conjecture, the process can become tedious as there can be thousands of cases that need to be tested. This process can only be used if there are a finite process. For a problem requiring an infinite number of cases, see
				<a href='02_induction.html'>Proof by Induction</a>
