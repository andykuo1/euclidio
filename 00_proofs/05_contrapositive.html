		<h1>Proof By Contrapositive</h1>
		<article>
			<p>
				A proof by contraposition is a form of indirect proof that begins with the assumption that the conclusion is false. It then proceeds to arrive at the hypothesis being false. If you are trying to prove $P\rightarrow Q$ (if $P$, then $Q$), you start with
				$\lnot Q$ (not $Q$) and arrive at a new conclusion, which is the hypothesis being false $\lnotP$ (not $P$), the contrapositive. Please do not confuse this with <a href='03_contradiction.html'>Proof by Contradiction</a>.

			<h2>Difference Between Contrapositive vs Contradiction</h2>
			<p>
				The difference between these two methods are subtle. Visualize it like this:
				<br /> 1. Contradiction : Assume $P$ and NOT $Q$. Then prove a new statement which is known to be false ($R$ and NOT $R$)
				<br /> 2. Contrapositive : Assume NOT $Q$. Then prove NOT $P$

			<h2>When to use Direct Proof vs When to use Contrapositive Proof</h2>
			<p>
				Use a Direct Proof when the hypothesis is more simple. Use an Indirect Proof when the conclusion is more simple.
				<br />
			</p>
			<hr />
			<p>
				When proving biconditionals, statements where it is necessary to prove if $P$, then $Q$ AND if $Q$, then $P$, it is convenient to use a direct proof to prove it in one direction and an proof by contrapositive to show that it works in the other direction.
