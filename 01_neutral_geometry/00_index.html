			<h1>Neutral Geometry</h1>
			<p>
				Now, we will start with the fundamental ideas of geometry starting with neutral geometry. Neutral geometry is the most basic of all geometries. It is in essence Euclidean Geometry without Euclid's Parallel Postulate. Surprisingly, much can be derived without knowing if two lines are parallel. That being said we will use Hilbert's Axioms instead of Euclid's Postulates in order to prove many of the theorems that you may or may not have recognized in your geometry class. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As you will see later, Euclid had many assumptions in mind (this may sound like your middle school or high school geometry) which later mathematicians eventually made evident. Although much of these concepts are pretty intuitive, the mathematical jargon does indeed obscure much of the meaning and application behind these powerful concepts. This website presents these concepts in a light where only algebra is required.
			</p>
			<p>
			Algebra and geometry are more similar than many people believe. Like algebra has its definitions and properties for numbers and operators and functions, geometry also has similar definitions and properties for points, lines, planes. More specifically, numbers correspond to length and direction (angle). Operators and functions correspond to the constructions that give meaning to these geometric creations.
			</p>
			<p>
				What remains the same regardless of the problem being algebraic or geometric is the way to prove a certain relationship. Axioms, Definitions, and Properties are still used to prove Propositions, Lemmas, and Theorems. What applies to algebra also applies to geometry making them both within the realms of mathematics.
			</p>
			<p>
				One thing to note is that while algebra is built on abstract concepts like numbers and counting, geometry is built on visual concepts like points and lines. However, contrary to contrary belief, <em>THIS DOES NOT MAKE GEOMETRY ANY EASIER THAN ALGEBRA!!!</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				Here is a table to show the connections between Algebra and Geometry.
